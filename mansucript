\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Training in quantitative methods is essential for psychology students \citep{ordetal2016, norcrossetal2016, stoloffetal2009, stoloffetal2012, ruggeri2011, counselletal2016}. However, research consistently shows that taking a quantitative methods course is stress and/or anxiety inducing in many students \citep{balouglu2003, dunn2000, onwuegbuziewilson2003, sizemorelewandowski2009, smith2014, connersetal1998, onwuegbuzie2004, onwuegbuzie1999, chewdillon2014, kesicietal2011}. The issue of statistics (quantitative) anxiety is so severe that recent reviews have called for a renewed research agenda focus on antecedents of and interventions for statistics anxiety \citep{chewdillon2014}. Compounding this issue, the field of quantitative methods is quickly changing as topics such as the ``New'' statistics \citep{cumming2014}, statistical modeling \citep{rodgers2010}, and Bayesian statistics \citep{gelmanshalizi2013} become more popular. Although teaching these newer concepts is happening slowly \citep{friedrichetal2018}, as both psychology and quantitative methods progress, it will become necessary for psychology students to understand more complex quantitative topics. Further complicating this area, research shows that quantitative attitudes can be equally important with quantitative abilities in predicting students' grades \citep{harlowetal2002, ramirezetal2012, ruggeri2011, schutzetal1998, sizemorelewandowski2009, smith2014, tempelaaretal2007} and if students will take more than the required quantitative courses for their degree \citep{evans2007, meeceetal1990}. Thus, research exploring ways to help students overcome their quantitative anxiety is a critical component to effectively teach psychology students and to help advance the field both short- and long-term.

From the field of positive psychology, two constructs may be of interest to help students overcome their quantitative anxiety to perform well in quantitative courses. These are resilience, commonly but not universally defined as positive adaptation in the face of adversity \citep{fletchersarkar2013, masten2015}, and grit, defined as ``perseverance and passion for long-term goals'' \citep[p. 1087]{duckworthetal2007}. When applying these concepts to quantitative anxiety, taking the quantitative course could be considered the adverse experience, and a from a resilience outcome perspective \citep{fletchersarkar2013, masten2015}, performing well and/or feeling confident in one's statistical abilities could be a sign of positive adaption. From a grit perspective, knowing that performing well in a quantitative course and understanding quantitative methods is necessary for long-term goals of obtaining a psychology degree (or becoming a psychologist) could strengthen the resolve of students to perform well despite their anxiety.

Previous studies of academic achievement show that there is an association between grit \citep{woltershussain2015, haggerhamilton2018, bazelaisetal2016, weisskirch2018, hwangetal2017, hodgeetal2018, flanaganeinarson2017} and resilience  \citep{colliemartin2017, swansonetal2011, allanetal2014,bormanoverman2004, wasongaetal2003, wasonga2002} with academic achievement.  Starting with resilience, a study of early adolescent Mexican Americans found that parent-reported ego resilience predicted academic achievement \citep{swansonetal2011}. \cite{allanetal2014} showed that in a sample of freshmen undergraduate students, resilience measured at the start of the semester was associated with end of term academic outcomes. Moreover, \cite{allanetal2014} found a gender effect where higher resilience was associated with higher academic outcomes but higher resilience was associated with lower academic outcome in men. Similar gender effects were found by \cite{wasonga2002}, although in her sample of high school students women did have higher levels of resilience than men but that higher levels were not related to higher academic achievement. Specifically in mathematics, \cite{bormanoverman2004} found that resilience was related to mathematics self-efficacy in a sample of elementary school students. \cite{colliemartin2017} reported similar results in a sample of 7th, 8th, and 9th grade students, where student-reported adaptability, a construct similar to resilience, positively predicted both engagement in mathematics and achievement in mathematics. Teacher-reported adaptability was also a positive predictor of mathematics achievement. Moving to grit, \cite{woltershussain2015} showed there were significant associations between grit, academic achievement, and self-regulated learning in undergraduate students. Similar findings were found in a sample of secondary school students, where grit predicted science grades \citep{haggerhamilton2018}, grit also predicted physics grades in first-year college students \citep{bazelaisetal2016}, estimated grades \citep{weisskirch2018}, and grade point averages in undergraduate students studying in Korea \citep{hwangetal2017}. \cite{hodgeetal2018} found that grit mediated a relationship between academic engagement and productivity, which could be interpreted as higher grit is related to higher engagement and thus greater productivity. In a biology class, a study by \cite{flanaganeinarson2017} explored the relationships between math confidence, grit, and student performance. Their results showed that the relationship between grit and student performance was mediated by math confidence, suggesting grit plays the strongest role in students with low math confidence.


\subsection{The Current Study}
Given that training in quantitative methods is necessary for psychology students \citep{ordetal2016, norcrossetal2016, stoloffetal2009, stoloffetal2012, ruggeri2011, counselletal2016}, and the negative affect commonly associated with these classes \citep{balouglu2003, dunn2000, onwuegbuziewilson2003, sizemorelewandowski2009, smith2014, connersetal1998, onwuegbuzie2004, onwuegbuzie1999, chewdillon2014, kesicietal2011}, research on helping students cope with quantitative anxiety is necessary to help train the current generations of psychologists and progress the field forward. Building on the work of \cite{flanaganeinarson2017} and \cite{colliemartin2017} the purpose of this study was to test if grit and/or resilience help students overcome quantitative anxiety. Specifically, it was hypothesized that grit and/or resilience were partial mediators of the hypothesized negative relationship between quantitative anxiety and quantitative self-efficacy. This hypothesis was explored using Bayesian mixed effects modeling, following the steps described by \cite{yuanmackinnon2009}.
