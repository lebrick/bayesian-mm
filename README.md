bayesian mediation model - grit/resil and quant attitudes

collaboration between zjk and ladb

testing if grit and/or resilience are partial mediators of theorized negative relationship between quantiative anxiety and quantitative self-confidence (or self-esteem?)

basic lit review outline:

statistics are an essential training component in psychology, public health, other disciplines

student attitudes towards quantitative methods are overwhelmingly negative, yet research suggests attitudes are just as important as abilities in predicting course success

resilience defined as "positive adaptation when faced with adverse experience," possible mediator as the quantitative class is an adverse experience and positive adaptation would be developing self-confidence/self-esteem

grit defined as "perseverance of effort combined with passion toward long-term goal," possible mediator since completing training in quantitaitve methods is a requirement for degrees in psychology/public health/bachelor's degree

methods:

participants
n=456 students at URI all from introductory statistics courses (could filter for just introductory psychological statistics), predominantly white and female sample

materials
QA, QSC/QSE, Grit, Resil (provide coefficient omega for reliability)

procedure
surveyed 3 times over semester (beginning, middle, end) online via qualtrics, received 1 EC point per survey completed for 3 possible points

results:

descriptives, test for MCAR/MVN

create/report factor scores for measures

follow steps for BMM using Yuan & MacKinnon (2009) as guide

discussion:

restate results/support of specific aims

integrate with extant literature

limitations

future directions
